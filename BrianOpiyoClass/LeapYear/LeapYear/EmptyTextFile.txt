1. Procedural programming languages
 - Follows a sequence of statements or commands in order to achieve a desired output.
 - Each series of steps is called a procedure, and a program written in one of these
   languages will have one or more procedures within it.
 - e.g C, C++, java, Pascal, BASIC

2. Functional programming languages
 - Focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations.
 - Each function, a reusable module of code, performs a specific task and returns a result.
 - e.g Scala, Erlang, Haskell, Elixir, F#

3. Object-oriented programming
 - Treats a program as a group of object composed of data and program elements, known as
   attributes and methods.
 - Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs.
 - e.g java, python, php, C++, ruby.

4. Scripting languages
 - Used to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in
   larger applications.
 - e.g php, ruby, python, bash, perl, node.js
