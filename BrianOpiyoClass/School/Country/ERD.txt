Entity Citizen:
Id_Number (PK)
Dob
Gender
Address
Voter_Registration
Tax_Number

Entity Person:
Id_Number (PK, FK - Citizen)
Name

Entity Student:
Id_Number (PK, FK - Person)
Admission_Number
Grade

Entity Teacher:
Id_Number (PK, FK - Person)
Tsc_Number

Here:
'Id_Number' in the 'Person' entity is both a Primary Key and a Foreign Key referencing the 'Citizen' entity.
'Id_Number' in the 'Student' entity is both a Primary Key and a Foreign Key referencing the 'Person' entity.
'Id_Number' in the 'Teacher' entity is both a Primary Key and a Foreign Key referencing the 'Person' entity.

This means that for every 'Student' record, there is a corresponding 'Person' record, and for every 'Person'
there is a corresponding 'Citizen'.The same applies to entity 'Person'.



   Citizen
      |
    Person
      /  \
     /    \
 Teacher  Student


This is a multi-level inheritance where 'Person' is a specialized version of 'Citizen' with 'Student' and 'Teacher'
being a specialized version of 'Person'.

Using these primary keys and foreign keys in your database schema will ensure that the inheritance relationship between
entities is maintained.

When it comes to the implementation of these relationships in a relational database, you have three alternatives as per
stackoverflow.com:

1. Create only a table for the superclass: All attributes and associations of subclasses are moved to the table corresponding
to the superclass with the possibility of taking a NULL value.

2. Create only tables for the subclasses: All attributes and associations of the superclass are repeated in each subclass.

3. Create tables both for the superclass and for each of the subclasses: In this case, the primary key (PK) of the subclasses
is also a foreign key (FK) to the superclass. This ensures that all identifiers in a subclass table correspond to an existing
identifier in the superclass table. A join between both tables allows recovering the full information of the element.
