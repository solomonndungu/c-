An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are build to work together and form a logical unit of functionality.

Assemblies take the form of executable (.exe) or dynamic link library (.dll) files, and are the building blocks of .NET
applications.

They provide the common language runtime (CLR) with the information it needs to be aware of type implementations.

To reference two assemblies with the same fully-qualified type names, an alias must be specified at a command prompt:
/r:GridV1=grid.dll
/r:GridV2=grid20.dll

This creates the external aliases GridV1 and GridV2. To use these aliases from within a program, reference them by using
the extern keyword.

extern alias GridV1;
extern alias GridV2;

Each extern alias declaration introduces an additional root-level namespace that parallels (but does not lie within)
the global namespace.
