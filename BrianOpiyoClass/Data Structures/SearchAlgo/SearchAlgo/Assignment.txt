// Identify all other string operations that exist and implement them


// Research on extension method and convert the given lines into extension method operated against
// an integer array

if (nums.Length == 1) // Base case: If the array has only one element
{
    if (nums[0] == target)
        return 0; // Return the index if it matches the target
    else
        return -1; // Return -1 if the target is not found
}



// Convert line 101 to 115 into extension method returning two halves into dictionary





// Over the weekend, learn about the shortcut commands

// Try executing the method splitArray and CheckSingleElement without calling it against the extended type/class
// Ensure your code runs

// Copy everything in this code to a new file and use lambda expressions instead of extensions
// Ensure each file contains only one class. Make sure both programs returns exactly the same results when
// given the same input

// Bonus point to improve on interactivity of the code, make changes to allow users to enter new arrays without
//having to stop and start the program. Also give it an exit in case we want to stop running the loop.
